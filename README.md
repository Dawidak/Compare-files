# Compare-files
Program is comparing all files in it's directoty and subdirectories.
It's comparing contents of one file to all the rest and then does the same with next file. It it finds maching files, it writes their paths in console.

This program is very basic and slow. I'm gonna try to make it better but I lack skills to do it for now :P
